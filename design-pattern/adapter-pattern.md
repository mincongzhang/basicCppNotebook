### Adapter pattern

(also known as Wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the Decorator pattern) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.[1] It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
An example is an adapter that converts the interface of a Document Object Model of an XML document into a tree structure that can be displayed.
