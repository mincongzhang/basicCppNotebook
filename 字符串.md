## 字符串\(String\)

[http://www.prglab.com/cms/pages/c-tutorial/advanced-data/character-sequences.php](http://www.prglab.com/cms/pages/c-tutorial/advanced-data/character-sequences.php)

`char*`is a pointer to an unbounded array of characters. Traditionally we consider such an array to be a C-string if it contains a set of valid characters followed by a`\0`. There's no limit to the size of the array.

`const char*`is a pointer to an unbounded array of \_immutable \_characters.



A`char*`can be automatically cast to a`const char*`, but not vice versa. Note that old C++ compilers had a special exception to the type rules to let you do this:

```
char * s ="String";
```

...without producing a type error; this was for C compatibility. Modern C++ compilers won't let you do it \(such as recent gccs\). They require this:

```
const char * s = "String";
```
