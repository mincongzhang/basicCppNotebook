## 字符串\(String\)

[http://www.prglab.com/cms/pages/c-tutorial/advanced-data/character-sequences.php](http://www.prglab.com/cms/pages/c-tutorial/advanced-data/character-sequences.php)



`char*`is a pointer to an unbounded array of characters. Traditionally we consider such an array to be a C-string if it contains a set of valid characters followed by a`\0`. There's no limit to the size of the array.

`const char*`is a pointer to an unbounded array of _immutable _characters.
